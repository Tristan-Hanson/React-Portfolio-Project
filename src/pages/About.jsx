                <p id='about-text'>Hello, my name is Tristan! I am an aspiring web developer and will soon graduate from the University of Minnesota coding bootcamp. Currently I enjoy working more in the back end, but I look forward to developing my skills on the front end in the future. Outside of web-development I am a big hockey fan. I played through high school and continue to play in pickup leagues when time permits. </p>
